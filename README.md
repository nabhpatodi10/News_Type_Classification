# News Type Classification

This is a News Type Classification project that uses Random Forest to predict the type of news based on the News Headline and a Small Description of the News (optional). The project includes a Jupyter Notebook file used to train the model and a dataset obtained from Kaggle, with some modifications made to it for better results.

## Introduction

This project is designed to classify news articles into different categories using machine learning. It employs a Random Forest model and a custom-designed TkInter interface for ease of use.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Download the model and dataset files:

   - [Pre-trained Model (model.zip)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-ZvYUHOhDHddfgD_7xgEkQEqI1txr9S/view?usp=sharing)
   - [Modified Dataset (News_Category_Dataset_v3.zip)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cdygtFDLhNy3N60_7KlrgwyKZlh3Bt2Y/view?usp=sharing)

2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip files into the project directory.

3. Run the TkInter interface:

```shell
window.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to input news headlines and descriptions for classification.

## Usage

To use the project programmatically, you can refer to the Jupyter Notebook for model training and experimentation.

Feel free to contribute or share your ideas for enhancing this project!
